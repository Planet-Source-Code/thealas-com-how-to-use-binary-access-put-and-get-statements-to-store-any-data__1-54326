' This is what you will learn:
' TO WRITE FILES:

'    Open App.Path & "\test.dat" For Binary Access Write As #1
'        Put #1, 1, Data
'    Close #1

' TO READ FILES;

'    Open App.Path & "\test.dat" For Binary Access Read As #1
'        Get #1, 1, Data
'    Close #1

' That's all, now have a look at the example

' You can use ReadFile and WriteFile apis, but in VB you dont need
' this at all
